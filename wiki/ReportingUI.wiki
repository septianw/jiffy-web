= Meaningful Reporting =

Measuring performance in near-time requires an efficient and extendible mechanism to be effective.  Reporting on the data should meet three primary requirements:

  # Timely - The data should be available as quick as possible. If it takes too long to see what's going on, you will not be able to act responsibly.
  # Multi-format - A report available from only one place cannot reach all those who need to know the data. The data needs to be available in multiple formats through multiple means.
  # Plentiful - there should be enough data to draw definitive conclusions   

= What we've completed = 

There's some good example code that generates single dynamic report with a chart. This report supports graphing at matrix of objects measurements over time. A configuration file uses presets to define the events that are going to be shown on the graph.

= To Be Done =

  # Porting reporting to different databases, right now it only works against an Oracle XE database instance.
  # Enable interval reporting with database rollups. Currently only a 1 hour interval is available. The plan is to support intervals varying from minutes to days and years.
  # Support non-contiguous time selections spanning days (eg: peak hours, weekdays, etc.)
  # Additional server-side components.

= Current Files = 

The current files in the reporting samples are:

  # dbconn.inc.php - database connect settings
  # report.php - server-side php script to pull data from the database
  # report.html - the web page
  # report.js - graphing engine
  # [ReportEventsConfig config.js] - file to configure events
